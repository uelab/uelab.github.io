An important part of this course will involve learning through reading about ethics and applying concepts from the reading to current technologies. We will read a survey of seven ethical frameworks, and you will be responsible for writing a short response to each.

Submit your written response through the class Canvas site discussion board. Responses should be approximately 300 words. Your written responses will be graded credit/no credit and must be thoughtful to receive credit. They must also draw connections to modern technology.
