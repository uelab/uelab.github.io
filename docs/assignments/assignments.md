      In this week's in-class studio, you will be designing a gig economy platform grounded in Utilitarian principles. In preparation, use the Judgment Call card deck from class to generate three product reviews. Each student should write and submit their three reviews independently. When envisioning your product, its impact, and stakeholders’ responses, keep in mind that the platform is grounded in Utilitarian principles. How might these principles translate into features and how might these features shape stakeholders' experiences? Submit on Canvas before class, and then bring your three reviews to class to share with your group during studio.

      This week, you will be designing an online dating app grounded in the principles of deontology. In preparation for studio, from the end of class on Tuesday until the start of class on Thursday, keep a sketch journal. Throughout the day, think of features or design concepts that would (or wouldn’t!) be a good fit for your app. When ideas come to you, quickly sketch them in your journal. Add a few words to help you remember the most important parts of your idea. Your drawings do not need to look nice! The goal is to think expansively and to capture your thoughts.
      <br>
      Your journal should include at least 20 sketches. Before class on Thursday, choose three designs and apply the universalize-your-maxim test to each one. For each one, write one sentence describing whether you think the feature passes or fails the test and why. Submit a single file on Canvas that includes photos of all sketches, indicates which three features you attempted to universalize, and the results of each of these three tests. Bring this content to class on Thursday to share with your teammates.

      This week in studio, you will be designing an eCommerce platform (like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, or Target) with consideration for Care Ethic principles. In preparation, complete this mindful usage exercise in which you observe your own interactions with the eCommerce platform you use most frequently.
      <ul>
        <li>Print or open the Mindful Usage template on Canvas and use it to take notes</li>
        <li>Go to the eCommerce app or website you use most frequently (if you never make purchases online use Amazon for this exercise)</li>
        <li>Use the platform as you normally do, paying attention both to the activities you are performing and to what you are experiencing in your mind and body as you perform them. Use this information to notice your habitual patterns of behavior, what motivates them, and how these patterns affect you. Take notes as you do so</li>
        <li>After you have finished, go back and reflect on how your usage experience might affect your ability to practice a Care Ethic. For example, at each step, what care are you receiving and from whom? What care needs are you noticing and what care needs are you oblivious to? Who are you connected to through your usage? How does the platform support or impeded your ability to practice attentiveness, responsibility, competence, responsiveness?</li>
      </ul>
      Submit a single file on Canvas with your template and your reflection. If you feel that anything you have written is too personal to share, you may redact it from the version you submit. Bring this output to class to use during studio.

        <li>A copy of the materials you will use for gathering user input (e.g., interview guides, survey questions, observation procedures, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      Your proposal report should be less than 2 pages. The accompanying materials should be added at the end as an appendix and can be any length.
